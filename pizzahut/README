Socket design:

  on init:
    - Create a new Thread with a reference to the plugin that simply
      loops and accepts whatever connection it receives.  It can die,
      or keep looping to potentially receive more connections. 

      This thread will assign the socket (or outputstream) the plugin 
      needs to continue going, without blocking the execution.
