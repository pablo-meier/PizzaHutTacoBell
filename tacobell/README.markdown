Now for your tacos...
=====================

Dependencies
------------
You'll need:

* A Flex SDK
* ant

To build, just 'ant -DFLEX\_HOME="&lt;path\_to\_flex\_sdk&gt;"' You can also go
into the build file and hard-code it, like I did.


Warning
-------
TACOBELL doesn't work when wrapped by XSplit's Wrapper SWF, which it will be if 
the SWF is located outside of XSplit's application folder. I'll figure this out,
someday, I totally promise it will definitely happen.
